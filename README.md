# WotD-Bot
A basic Discord bot that sends a message upon user request of the word of the day. Words are selected by the user by use of a text file.

All files can be downloaded and put into a Python project. The '.env' file needs to be changed in order to take in a bot token and a server/guild to run in. 'DISCORD_TOKEN' is a bot token that is generated from the developer page where the bot is created. This token is unique to each bot. 'DISCORD_GUILD' is simply the name of the guild/server that the bot is currently invited to.
